[00:00.15] We on?
[00:01.86] A'ight
[00:03.22] One, two, three, go!
[00:13.22] 
[00:06.45] Waking up in a dream
[00:08.03] Sleepwalking on another big stage
[00:09.82] You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
[00:12.04] Your name in unison, I'm so far away
[00:14.10] From the place I used to be, struggling usually
[00:16.51] Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
[00:18.92] I can feel the energy in the air
[00:21.12] It feel like I'm supposed to be here
[00:39.12] 
[00:23.23] Everywhere I go, I'm getting so much love
[00:25.69] Fans, the stars, everyone
[00:27.78] Sayin' how they can't wait for the LP
[00:29.97] And I'm gonna blow, they believe in me
[00:32.25] Feel so good in what you do
[00:34.91] Helps somebody else get through
[00:36.53] That's why I do the best I can
[00:38.94] Because I know how blessed I am
[00:54.44] 
[00:41.36] I'm so high, I can touch the sky
[00:45.19] I know it's my time, and it's now or never
[00:50.18] Shine so bright, I light the night
[00:54.10] And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
[01:15.60] 
[00:59.59] A fool if I take it all for granted
[01:01.56] A smart man if I keep my feet planted
[01:03.44] To the earth, 'cause the people that hurt can understand it
[01:05.89] You speakin' outlandish, I'ma show you how to make it all work
[01:08.59] Another planet, it's a short term goal for me
[01:10.63] A record sold for me, it's just more of me in your ear
[01:13.80] For you to hear Kendrick persevere, defenses I feel relentless
[01:44.80] 
[01:17.76] Ambition with a clear vision
[01:19.49] Takin' off, I ain't takin' off these Pistons
[01:21.47] I'm takin' off on the inner me, you're distance
[01:23.79] Came across me, how much it'll cost me
[01:25.74] To get you out my business
[01:27.30] I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
[01:30.31] I'm past that, now pass that award
[01:32.70] Not one but four times two plus yours
[01:51.20] 
[01:34.91] I see myself performing there (K.dot)
[01:37.12] Sold out shows where the room is packed
[01:39.20] Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
[01:41.63] See myself on big billboards
[01:44.05] Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
[01:46.30] Can't imagine how it feels
[01:48.02] That's why I'm smiling everyday
[01:50.62] Because my dream ain't far away
[02:06.12] 
[01:52.85] I'm so high, I can touch the sky
[01:56.92] I know it's my time, and it's now or never
[02:01.66] Shine so bright, I light the night
[02:05.70] And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
[02:27.20] 
[02:10.79] You looking at me, and you tell me I'm blessed
[02:12.85] Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
[02:15.08] Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
[02:16.99] You see me when at my best, my worst
[02:19.05] This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
[02:21.24] With a curse research my paid dues, I'm reimbursed
[02:24.14] I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
[02:26.24] I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile
[02:48.24] 
[02:28.64] And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
[02:30.58] You can break bread with me now
[02:31.94] We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
[02:34.11] Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
[02:36.48] And walked that mile
[02:37.52] In the darkness I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I wrote
[02:40.72] When you told me that it spoke to your soul
[02:42.44] I was talking to you, I was walking it through every ghetto
[02:45.36] Tell success "Hello"
[02:46.77] We here
[02:50.27] 
[02:47.29] And I'm so happy I cry 'cause I can't believe
[02:51.78] All the things I ever wanted are finally happening for me
[02:56.42] And it's so surreal that I almost feel
[03:00.62] That any minute I can wake up from this fantasy
[03:05.18] When you pray so hard, and you've come so far
[03:09.58] And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
[03:14.90] And I'm gonna do it, watch me
[03:29.40] 
[03:18.10] I'm so high, I can touch the sky
[03:21.86] I know it's my time, and it's now or never
[03:26.83] Shine so bright, I light the night
[03:30.86] And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
[03:52.36] 
[03:35.92] I'm so high, I can touch the sky
[03:39.65] I know it's my time, and it's now or never
[03:44.75] Shine so bright, I light the night
[03:48.78] And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
